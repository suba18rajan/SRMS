STUDENT RESULT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING PYTHON:<br> 
            Student Result Management System is a web-based application that mainly focuses on providing the results to the student and the faculty. The student checks their respective results using their university registered recognition id’s along with their grades and percentage of that semester. The student accessing their results through college site is more convenient and the faculty can easily analyze the pass and failure of a particular subject. The student using his roll number can view his results. Administrator has the power to add new user and can edit and delete user. Student Result Management System is a technological opportunity for the school, college, university and coaching centre institutions searching for a secure, simple and alternative solution to the conventional paper-based exam results evaluation, reporting and distribution.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
            All the system can be faced with the problems which are huge or small system. The problems that are faced in the student’s results  management   system are  wrong information, wrong results, delay results implementing and duplicating results. One of the problems which can happened in this result management system is delay results implementing. When there is delay problems, the students wanted to be decreased that delay and that can also reduce the profit
of this system. And then the admin of this system needs to care about this problem

TECHNOLOGY USED:
 	The Student Result Management System uses technologies like Php, Python, MySQL to provide real-time data insights and automate time-consuming tasks. In this Project, I have used the Python Language with Database using Visual Studio Code Tool. It manages all the information about Result, Student Details, Course. All the fields such as Result, Student, Course are validated and does not take invalid values. The admins can easily search the data of the student, even they can add, delete, update, search and export the data easily. 
           
FUTURE WORK:
      In summary, the future scope of the project includes:
•Generating certificates for students.
•Adding more security to prevent hacks.
•Adding more advanced features to the Student Result Management System.
•Hosting the platform on online servers for worldwide accessibility. In the past, data used to be manually inserted for result analysis, but now the project uses SQL files for data extraction.
•Data can be fetched and parsed in various formats such as doc, csv, and odt. Additionally, there is potential for data visualization using pie charts, graphs, and other methods. 
•The project can be made more interactive and user friendly by adding features such as a group chat for students to discuss various engineering issues, thus fulfilling each user's needs in the best way possible.
